# TDD Tutorial
This project is a Flutter application developed as part of the course "Flutter Firebase Test Driven Development And Clean Architecture" taught by Dastagir Ahmed (dbestech / Udemy). It serves as a practical tutorial to learn and apply the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Flutter projects, promoting the writing of more reliable, clean, and maintainable code.

## Objective

The main goal of this tutorial is to teach how to effectively implement TDD, covering the following topics:
- Writing tests before implementing the code.
- Refactoring code safely.
- Ensuring the code meets specified requirements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into stages that follow the TDD cycle:
1. **Write a failing test**: Create a test that describes the expected behavior.
2. **Make the test pass**: Implement the minimal code required to pass the test.
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping the tests green.

## Prerequisites

- **Language**: Dart (SDK >= 3.1.4 < 4.0.0).
- **Framework**: Flutter.
- **Testing Tools**: `flutter_test`, `mocktail`, `bloc_test`.
- **Others**: Additional dependencies like `equatable`, `dartz`, `flutter_bloc`, `get_it`.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```
